# Using AI

When starting on fluffy in week 2,
I wanted to try to learn how to effectively use
GitHub CoPilot to help me write code.

I had heard about it from a friend and was curious
to see how it would work.
(This Markdown file was
written with CoPilot's help.)

I also used ChatGPT for refactoring to use handlers.
